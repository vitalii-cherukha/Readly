📝 Description

Readly is a collaborative web project — an interactive online bookstore with a fully responsive design.
The app allows users to browse a dynamic collection of books, filter them by category, and navigate through pages using pagination.
The interface is powered by API-driven content, smooth UI interactions, and real-time user notifications.

I was responsible for the Books section, where I implemented:

API integration to fetch and render book data

Pagination and category filtering logic

Dynamic updates of the gallery based on user interactions

The project was developed using Vite for fast builds and modular JS structure for scalability.

🧩 Features

Responsive layout (mobile-first)

Dynamic book gallery from REST API

Pagination and filtering

Interactive navigation using Swiper.js

User-friendly notifications with iziToast
